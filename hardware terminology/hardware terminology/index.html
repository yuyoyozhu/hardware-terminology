<p>An input device is any hardware device that sends signals to a processing system and allows you to interact with it. Common examples include, keyboards, mice and microphones.

<h2 id="first_point_2">Output Device</h2>

<p>An output device is any hardware device that recieves and converts information from a processing system into another form. Some expamples include monitors, speakers, and headphones.</p>

<h2 id="first_point_3">Central Processing unit (CPU)</h2>

<p>A CPU is the part of a computer that retrieves and executes instructions. It performs calculations, actions and runs programs. It is often known as the "brain" of the computer. </p>

<h2 id="first_point_4">Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h2>

<p>The ALU is the part of the CPU that performs arithmetic logic operations such as OR and AND. It allows computers to perform mathematical operations with binary numbers.</p>

<h2 id="first_point_5">Control Unit</h2>

<p>The control unit is a part of the computer's processor, and its  function is to convert computer processor's operation instructions into control signals.</p>

<h2 id="first_point_6">Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>

<p>RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It is very fast and stores data that the computer needs for a short amount of time, going away when the power turns off. </p>

<h2 id="first_point_7">Optical Memory</h2>

<p>Optical memory is a type of electronic storage where data from optical media is written and read with a laser. Common examples of optical media include CDs and DVDs.</p>

<h2 id="first_point_8">Magnetic Memory</h2>

<p>Magnetic memory is the storage of data on a magnetized medium. It uses magnetisation patterns to store data. </p>

<h2 id="first_point_9">Flash Memory</h2>

<p>Flash memory is a type of memory that doesn't require power to store data. It is high speed and electrically programmable. </p>

<h2 id="first_point_10">Logic Gates</h2>

<p>Logic gates are device performing Boolean logic operations on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output. They are the basic building blocks of any digital system. </p>
